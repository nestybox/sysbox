## Supported Architectures

The following table summarizes the architectures where Sysbox is currently supported.

It is important to highlight that Sysbox implementation is expected to be fully
platform agnostic. Thus, it should be relatively easy to extend the number of
supported architectures -- it's expected to be mostly a testing/validation exercise.

| Architecture  | Supported Sysbox release |
| ------------- | :----------------------: |
| amd64         |    v0.1.0+               |
| arm64         |    v0.5.0+               |


Please file a new issue if you have a use-case that requires a non-supported
architecture.
