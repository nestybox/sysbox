# Sysbox User Guide: Installation

The method of installation for Sysbox depends on the environment where Sysbox
will be installed:

*   [Kubernetes Clusters](install-k8s.md)

*   [Package Install](install-package.md)

*   [Build and install from source](../developers-guide/README.md)

    - If a package for your distro is not yet available, or if you want to get the latest changes from upstream.

**NOTE: See the [distro compatibility doc](../distro-compat.md)
for the list of Linux distros where Sysbox is supported and the installation
methods supported for each. Also, see the [platform architecture doc](../arch-compat.md)
for the list of supported machine architectures (e.g., amd64, arm64).**
