# Sysbox User Guide: Installation

The method of installation for Sysbox depends on the environment where Sysbox
will be installed:

*   To install Sysbox on a Kubernetes cluster, use the [sysbox-deploy-k8s daemonset](install-k8s.md).

*   Otherwise, use the [Sysbox package](install-package.md) for your distro.

*   Alternatively, if a package for your distro is not yet available, or if you
    want to get the latest changes from upstream, you [build and install Sysbox from source](../developers-guide/README.md).

**NOTE: Before installing, see the [distro compatibility doc](../distro-compat.md)
for the list of Linux distros where Sysbox is supported and the installation
methods supported for each.**
