# Sysbox Developer's Guide

## Intro

This is the Sysbox developer's guide. It describes how to build Sysbox from
source, install it, and test it. It's meant for developers that want to
contribute or do a deeper dive on Sysbox.

If you are just looking to use Sysbox and don't want to build it from source,
this document is not for you. In that case, we recommend going to the [Nestybox](https://www.nestybox.com)
website and downloading the packaged version of Sysbox.
