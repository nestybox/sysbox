## [0.6.1] - 2023-04-07
### Added
  * Added support for ID-mapped overlayfs lower layers; eliminates need for shiftfs and Sysbox rootfs chown; requires kernel 5.19+.
  * Have Sysbox perform shiftfs and ID-mapping functional checks during init (issue #596).

  * Added support for Kubernetes v1.24 to v1.26.
  * Added --disable-inner-image-preload flag to sysbox-mgr (speeds up Sysbox container startup).

  * Added --disable-shiftfs-on-fuse flag to sysbox-mgr; prevents Sysbox from mounting shiftfs on top of FUSE-backed filesystems (some of which don't work with shiftfs).
  * Added few optimizations to expedite I/O operations in procfs/sysfs emulated resources.
  * Enhanced life-cycle management of Sysbox daemons in Systemd-free scenarios.
  * Prevented concurrent execution of Sysbox daemons (multi-instance problem).

  * Don't assign more capabilities to the container than those given to Sysbox itself.
  * Don't fail in kernel distros without /lib/modules/<kernel-release>.

  * Extended kubelet config-detection process to multiple drop-in files in sysbox-deploy-k8s daemon-set.
  * Incorporated taints during sysbox-deploy-k8s installation process.
  * Fixed issue preventing sysbox-deploy-k8s installation in rke2 environments (issue #614).
