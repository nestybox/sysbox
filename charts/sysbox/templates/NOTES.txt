Sysbox has been installed!

1. Check that the Sysbox DaemonSet is running on your nodes:
   kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "sysbox.name" . }}" -o wide

2. Verify that the RuntimeClass has been created:
   kubectl get runtimeclass sysbox-runc

3. You can now deploy pods using Sysbox by adding the runtimeClassName:
   
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: my-sysbox-pod
   spec:
     runtimeClassName: sysbox-runc
     containers:
     - name: system-container
       image: ubuntu
       command: ["sleep", "inf"]
